## To-Do List Application Documentation

### Introduction

The "To-Do List" application is a simple web-based tool that allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with their tasks in a user-friendly manner.

### Features

1. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to the list by entering the task description and clicking the "Add Task" button.

2. **Edit Task:** Users can edit the description of an existing task by clicking the "Edit" button associated with that task. A prompt will appear, allowing the user to modify the task description.

3. **Delete Task:** Users can remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with that task.

### Files and Structure

The application consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This file contains the structure and layout of the application, including the task input field, buttons, and the task list.

2. `styles.css`: This file contains the styling and appearance of the application, making it visually appealing and easy to use.

3. `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling the application's functionality, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

### Usage

1. **Adding a Task:** To add a new task, type the task description into the input field labeled "Enter a new task." Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list. The task will appear as a list item with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

2. **Editing a Task:** To edit an existing task, click the "Edit" button associated with that task. A prompt will appear with the current task description. Modify the text as desired and click "OK" to save the changes.

3. **Deleting a Task:** To delete a task, click the "Delete" button associated with that task. The task will be removed from the list.

### Code Breakdown

1. The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the application, including input fields, buttons, and the task list (`<ul>`). It also includes a script reference to `script.js`.

2. The CSS file (`styles.css`) styles the application, providing a clean and visually appealing layout. It uses classes to style elements such as buttons and the task list.

3. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) adds functionality to the application. It handles the following:

   - Adding tasks to the list when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
   - Editing tasks by allowing users to modify task descriptions.
   - Deleting tasks from the list.

### Extensibility

This application serves as a simple example of a to-do list. You can extend its functionality by adding features such as task priorities, due dates, or categories. You could also enhance the UI with animations, better styling, and responsive design to make it suitable for different devices.

### Conclusion

The "To-Do List" application is a basic yet practical example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create an interactive web application. It showcases the power of these technologies in building user-friendly interfaces and handling user interactions effectively.
