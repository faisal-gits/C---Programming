## Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML

### Overview

In this lesson, you'll be introduced to HTML, the fundamental language used to create web pages. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that structures content on the web.

### Topics Covered

- What is HTML?
- Structure of an HTML document.
- HTML tags and elements.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand what HTML is and its role in web development.
2. Recognize the basic structure of an HTML document.
3. Identify HTML tags and their purpose.

### What is HTML?

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It is used to structure content on the web and define the layout, formatting, and elements of a web page. HTML uses a system of markup tags to define the different parts of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

### Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document consists of a set of elements enclosed in tags. Tags are surrounded by angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags defines the element's content.

A basic structure of an HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
- `<html>` is the root element that encloses the entire HTML content.
- `<head>` contains meta-information about the document, like the title of the web page.
- `<title>` sets the title of the web page that appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>` contains the visible content of the web page.
- `<h1>` is a heading element that defines a top-level heading.
- `<p>` is a paragraph element that contains text.

### HTML Tags and Elements

HTML tags define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are used to create elements, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML tags are case-insensitive, meaning `<h1>` and `<H1>` are equivalent.

Common HTML tags include:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings of varying levels.
- `<p>`: Paragraph.
- `<a>`: Anchor for creating hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Embeds images.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.
- `<li>`: List item.
- `<br>`: Line break.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, you've been introduced to HTML and its role in web development. You've learned about the basic structure of an HTML document, including elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. As you continue with this tutorial, you'll dive deeper into HTML elements and their attributes, gaining the skills to create well-structured web pages.
