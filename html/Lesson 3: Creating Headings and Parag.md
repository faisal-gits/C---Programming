## Lesson 3: Creating Headings and Paragraphs

### Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use headings and paragraphs to structure and present content in an HTML document.

### Topics Covered

- Using the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags for headings.
- The purpose and usage of the `<p>` tag for paragraphs.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Use the appropriate heading tags to create headings of different levels.
2. Understand the purpose and usage of the `<p>` tag to create paragraphs.

### Using the `<h1>` to `<h6>` Tags for Headings

HTML provides six levels of headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest. Headings are used to structure content and indicate hierarchy. Use them to emphasize sections and sub-sections of your content.

Example:

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<h2>Subheading 2</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
<!-- And so on... -->
```

### The Purpose and Usage of the `<p>` Tag for Paragraphs

The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It's a block-level element that adds spacing before and after the content. Paragraphs are useful for organizing and presenting text in a coherent manner.

Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text. It can contain multiple sentences.</p>
<p>Another paragraph with additional content.</p>
```
