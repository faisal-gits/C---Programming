### Page 2: Bootstrap Grid System and Layout

#### Section 1: Understanding the Grid System
Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful feature that allows you to create responsive layouts by dividing a webpage into rows and columns. Each row can contain up to 12 columns, and you can arrange your content within these columns to create flexible and responsive designs.

##### Basic Grid Structure:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the first half of the row -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the second half of the row -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- The `.container` class creates a responsive fixed-width container.
- The `.row` class is used to create a horizontal grouping of columns.
- The `.col-md-6` class specifies that each column should take up half of the row's width on medium-sized screens and above (`md` stands for medium).

#### Section 2: Responsive Classes
Bootstrap provides responsive classes to control the visibility and alignment of elements based on the screen size. Here are some commonly used classes:

- `.visible`: Shows the element on all screen sizes.
- `.invisible`: Hides the element on all screen sizes.
- `.hidden-sm-down`: Hides the element on small screens and below.
- `.hidden-md-up`: Hides the element on medium screens and above.

#### Section 3: Offset and Nesting
You can create more complex layouts by offsetting columns and nesting rows within columns.

##### Offset Example:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-2">
      <!-- Content for the first column with a 2-column offset -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <!-- Content for the second column -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### Nesting Example:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the first column -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <!-- Nested content -->
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <!-- Nested content -->
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <!-- Content for the second column -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Section 4: Exercise - Create a Responsive Layout
Practice creating a responsive layout with the Bootstrap grid system. Create a webpage with multiple rows and columns, adjusting their layout based on different screen sizes.

### Section 5: Next Steps
In the next page, we will explore Bootstrap components such as navigation bars, forms, buttons, and modals. These components will help you create interactive and user-friendly interfaces for your web projects.
