### Page 1: Introduction to Bootstrap

#### Section 1: What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that helps developers design responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript tools for layout, typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

#### Section 2: Why Use Bootstrap?
- **Responsive Design:** Bootstrap allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes, making your website mobile-friendly.
- **Time-Saving:** Bootstrap provides pre-designed components and styles, saving you time and effort in creating a consistent and modern-looking UI.
- **Customizable:** While Bootstrap offers ready-to-use components, you can also customize the framework to match your design needs.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Bootstrap ensures consistent appearance and behavior across different browsers.

#### Section 3: Prerequisites
Before you start learning Bootstrap, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### Section 4: Setting Up Your Development Environment
To begin using Bootstrap, you need to set up your development environment. You can either download Bootstrap files and host them locally or link to Bootstrapâ€™s Content Delivery Network (CDN) in your HTML files.

##### Option 1: Download Bootstrap Locally
1. Go to the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/).
2. Click on the "Download" button to download the Bootstrap files.
3. Extract the downloaded files to your project directory.

##### Option 2: Use Bootstrap via CDN
In your HTML file, include the following link in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Include the Bootstrap JavaScript file before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

#### Section 5: Your First Bootstrap Example
Let's create a simple Bootstrap webpage to see how it works. Open your favorite text editor and create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Bootstrap Tutorial</title>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Welcome to Bootstrap Tutorial!</h1>
    <p>This is your first Bootstrap-powered webpage.</p>
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me!</button>
  </div>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Section 6: Explanation of the Example
- The `<div class="container">` element creates a responsive container to hold the content.
- `<h1>` and `<p>` elements are standard HTML tags.
- The `<button>` element has the class `btn btn-primary`, which styles it as a Bootstrap button.

#### Section 7: What's Next?
